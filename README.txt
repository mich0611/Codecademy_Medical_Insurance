a. Data comes from insurance.csv, and I work on it though jupyter notebook.

b. Some possible ideas for analysis are the following : 

   1. Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.

   2. Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from.

   3. Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers.

   4. Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset.

   5. try to find the relationship between on target and the other.
